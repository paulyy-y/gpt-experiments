# GPT Experiments

This repository hosts projects that are co-piloted with GPT to
a large degree. The focus is on giving GPT autonomy and using as much prompting
as possible instead of hand-tailoring code.

Each project is contained within a subfolder and has its own README file with
specific details and instructions.
